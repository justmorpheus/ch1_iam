# learn-iam-policy

Labs helping you to learn how write IAM policies following the least privilege principle.

Are you looking for an instructor-led workshop based on these labs? Say [hello@widdix.net](mailto:hello@widdix.net).

## Introduction

We are using `<Variable>` to indicate that you should replace parts of the instructions with a variable.

## Preparing the lab environment

The CloudFormation template `lab-environment.yml` creates a lab environment consisting of:

* EC2 Instance with an IAM role attached (*access to SSM is granted for Session Manager access*)
* S3 bucket
* SSM parameters

1. Create a CloudFormation stack based on the template `lab-environment.yml`.
    1. Set stack name to your name but only use characters `a-z` (lowercase!).
1. Make a note with the outputs of the stack: `IamRole`, `S3Bucket`.
1. Connect to the EC2 instance using SSM Session Manager
    1. Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager/start-session
    1. Select your instance
    1. Push the **Start Session** button
    1. Jump to your home directory: `cd ~`
1. Done. You can now start with the labs.
